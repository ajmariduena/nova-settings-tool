Store and edit simple app-wide settings right in Nova. Settings are stored as JSON using [`spatie/valuestore`](https://github.com/spatie/valuestore), making them really easy to [pull in and use everywhere else in your app](https://laravel-news.com/global-application-settings).

## Installation

Install the package in any Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require bakerkretzmar/nova-settings-tool
```

Publish the included default configuration file to `config/settings.php` (optional, see below):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="settings-tool"
```

Register the tool with Nova in the `tools` method of your `NovaServiceProvider`:

```php
// in app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php

use Ajmariduena\SettingsTool\SettingsTool;

// ...

public function tools()
{
    return [
        new SettingsTool,
    ];
}
```

## Usage

Settings can be declared using a `settings.php` file in your app's `config` folder. This file lets you specify where your settings are stored, what the tool's title is in Nova's sidebar, the layout of the settings page, and information about the settings themselves.

This package includes a default config file that you can publish and use as a starting point:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="settings-tool"
```

The [default config](config/settings.php) contains examples that should be pretty self-explanatory, and lots of comments in case they aren't.

Each item in the `panels` array is rendered as its own 'group' of settings, like a panel on one of Nova's detail views. Each panel can have a name and contain settings, which are rendered as toggle switches or text inputs. Each setting can optionally have a description and a link to more information (e.g. docs). Only the setting's key and value are actually stored in your `settings.json` file.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```

I'm new to testing and would welcome testing-related PRs.
